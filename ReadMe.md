#    Blog(API)
    Create a blog platform where users can register, 
    login and can post their thoughts and comments. 
    Users can also like and dislike posts and comments. 
    Users should be able to add posts to favorites and 
    create a connection with other users. As a user, 
    I should be able to view the posts of everyone on the platform
    and also view the posts of all my connections only.
    Users should also be able to deactivate/delete their accounts,
    the deactivation should not happen immediately but should 
    be scheduled to run a certain time after the user deactivates.
    This allows the user to cancel the deactivation before its due date.
